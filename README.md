# Yogi Break
With this ever drawn-out pandemic, many of us have succumbed to the long hours at our desk behind a monitor. As we are by our lonesome, we have forgotten to take breaks to not only get a mental reprieve but also strengthen our muscles. Yogi Break offers to be our companion in these challenging times by providing consistent reminders to try a new yoga pose that will re-enforce our muscles and mind. 
  
## What it does
Navigate to Yogi Break and set the timer based on how often you want to get up and do a yoga pose. Are you constantly switching windows? No problem, you have the option to have the alerts go to your phone or your laptop. 
  
## Getting Started 
TODO

## How we built it 
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) was used to host our application
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) is the application framework used
- [Twilio Messaging Service](https://console.twilio.com/?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1) is used to send messages to users 
- [Lightning Yoga Api](https://lightning-yoga-api.herokuapp.com/) is used to provide the yoga data 

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to equally focus on frontend and backend to accomplish this project. This allowed us to explore different APIs while also creating a responsive webpage.

## What we learned
We learned how different technologies come together by utilizing Google Cloud to host our web-app and Flask to serve our application. Furthermore, we were able to draw from two API's (Twilio and Yogo Poses Dataset) to add even more functionality.
